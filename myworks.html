    <h2>Brocade Country</h2>
      <p>City Weekend, August 18, 2014, Shanghai</p>

      <p>Brocade Country co-owners and sisters Dawn and Yienzi Li have been spreading southwest Chinese culture in Shanghai for the past decade. Everything in their wood-furnished store is carefully handmade by women from Guizhou, Yunnan or Guanxi provinces. With varied, colorful embroidery and fabric, every product tells a different story of ethnic minorities and small tribes, whether itâ€™s a bag, a skirt, a jacket or a baby blanket.

    <h2>How to Use Alipay</h2>
      <p>City Weekend, August 26, 2014, Shanghai</p>

      <p>You've no doubt heard Chinese and expats alike extol the virtues of Taobao and other Chinese online marketplaces. But how do you make an online purchase? First off, ask your bank to give you online banking. Then, head to Alipay.com to set up an account there. Disclaimer: Alipay is entirely in Chinese, so make sure to grab a Chinese-literate friend if necessary.</p><a href="http://www.cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/blog/how-to-use-alipay-zhifubao/">Read more</a>
